        <h3 id="Ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sauce</strong><p>Chicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar, and brown sugar are whisked together to make a sweet and salty mixture to flavor the recipe.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Chicken</strong><p>Chef John minces skinless, boneless chicken thigh until they're very finely chopped. You could use packaged ground chicken to speed up the process, but chopping or grinding your own gives you superior flavor and texture.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Shallots and garlic</strong><p>Sliced shallots and minced garlic add another layer of flavor.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Hot chile peppers</strong><p>This is where the heat comes into play. Use Thai chile, serrano chile, or other hot pepper of your choice, and customize the amount to suit your tolerance for heat.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Basil</strong><p>This recipe traditionally uses Thai basil or "holy" basil, which have their own distinctive flavors. Chef John uses sweet basil, which is more readily available in most grocery stores. In the recipe video, Chef John demonstrates how he stacks and rolls basil leaves like a cigar to quickly slice thin ribbons that cook faster and impart flavor throughout the dish.</p></li>

        <h3 id="Directions">Directions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Step 1</strong><p>Whisk chicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl until well blended.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Step 2</strong><p>Heat large skillet over high heat. Drizzle in oil. Add chicken and stir fry until it loses its raw color, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in shallots, garlic, and sliced chilies. Continue cooking on high heat until some of the juices start to caramelize in the bottom of the pan, about 2 or 3 more minutes. Add about a tablespoon of the sauce mixture to the skillet; cook and stir until sauce begins to caramelize, about 1 minute.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Step 3</strong><p>Pour in the rest of the sauce. Cook and stir until sauce has deglazed the bottom of the pan. Continue to cook until sauce glazes onto the meat, 1 or 2 more minutes. Remove from heat.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Step 4</strong><p>Stir in basil. Cook and stir until basil is wilted, about 20 seconds. Serve with rice.</p></li>
